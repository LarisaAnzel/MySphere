Application for decoding of womans natural cycles ðŸŒ¸ðŸ©¸ðŸ¦‹



My sphere application is a novelty that upgrades menstrual cycle tracking to the next level!

With its unique features this app allows women to follow ups and downs of menstrual cycle and finally make sense of them. When looking at different studies aimed at womans understanding of their own menstrual cycle, I am always astonished by the numbers.There are so many women who do not understand their own body it is almost scary!

This is one of the reasons why this app was created. Its purpose is to give women tool to better understand ourselves and our nature.

To present this app I will highlight 4 most important functions it.

1. It is based on days of your menstrual cycle rather than on the calendar. With menstrual cycle trackers based on calendar you are always logging symptoms and notes onto a new blank page - however with this app you are always adding symptoms and notes to your cycle day and you are also able to see all notes and symptoms logged on that same day in previous cycles.

2. Option to add your own symptoms. This comes in very handy when you have uncommon symptoms or are interested in more details - for example this is how I figured that my taste changes during ovulation.

3. Trackers. Now this are a big one and one I am certainly very proud of. They give you an option to evaluate your symptoms with numbers. Normally when logging symptoms you can logg either you have it or not, but with this you can get greater insight into yourself. Energy levels are a nice example of how useful thus trackers can be! Also if you are prone to headaches it might be worth determining which day of the cycle your headaches are the worst - or maybe you might realise they are not even connected with your cycle.

4. Prediction for the future - get an overview of your next few days and prepare yourself for them! This one is great for organised ladyes who what to really optimise and maximise their wellbeing and productivity levels!


So, with all this I would like to invite you to join my testing community so we can make sure this app reache every woman that is still struggling to understand herself.
